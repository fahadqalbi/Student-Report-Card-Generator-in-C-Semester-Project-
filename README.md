# Student-Report-Card-Generator-in-C-Semester-Project-
This semester project focuses on developing a Student Report Card Generator using C++. The primary objective of this project is to create a comprehensive and efficient system for managing and generating report cards for students. This project aims to streamline the process of recording, calculating, and displaying student grades and performance.
Key features of the Student Report Card Generator include:
User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive console-based interface to interact with the system.
Student Information Management: Input and store essential student details such as name, roll number, and class.
Calculation: Enter subject-wise marks for each student and compute their total, average etc.
Report Card Generation: Automatically generate a formatted report card displaying all relevant information, including individual subject marks, total marks, average, and overall grade.
Data Storage: Save and retrieve student data for future reference, ensuring persistent storage of information.
This project not only enhances your programming skills in C++ but also provides practical experience in developing real-world applications. By the end of this project, you will have a functional and reliable system capable of efficiently managing student report cards, demonstrating your proficiency in C++ and your ability to solve complex problems through programming.
